# Reactively

Reactively is a library for fine grained reactive programming.
It's simple and lightweight.
Use Reactively to add smart recalculation and caching almost anywhere.

```jsx
example;
```

Of course, you can manually write your own caching and depency checking
to avoid repeating expensive operations
like memory allocation, network operations, storage, long computations, etc.
But a fine grained reactive declarative programming library like Reactively 
makes it easier and more maintainable.

Reactively provides fine grained reactivity and nothing more.
That makes Reactively small and easy to mix in to existing projects.
