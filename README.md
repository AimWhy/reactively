# Reactively

Reactively is a library for fine grained reactive programming.
It's simple and lightweight.

Reactively provides fine grained reactivity and nothing more.
Use Reactively to add smart recalculation and caching almost anywhere.

```jsx
example;
```

Of course, you can manually write your own caching and dependency checking
to avoid repeating expensive operations
(memory allocation, network operations, storage, long computations, DOM manipulation, etc.)
But a fine grained reactive declarative programming library like Reactively 
is easier and more maintainable.
